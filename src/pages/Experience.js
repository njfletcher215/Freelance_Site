        <ExperienceItem institution='Encyclopaedia Britannica' location='Chicago, IL' title='Quality Assurance Automation Engineer Intern' startDate='MAY 2022' endDate='APRIL 2023'>
          In this role I developed the necessary skills to work as a part of a software development team and ensure code and product 
          quality. I learned to create functional test cases, analyze web applications for potential points of failure, and optimize 
          code to minimize runtime. I also gained working knowledge of Python, Selenium, PyCharm, git/GitHub, and Chrome DevTools.

          In this role I developed the necessary skills to work independently, monitoring both product and code for potential 
          defectsâ€”then implementing a solution to undo or prevent said defects. I also learned to work within multiple environments 
          (prod and test), and manage those environments both directly through their CLIs and through cloud management software. 
          I learned to look for places where automation could save time and/or resources, and spearhead the automation process. 
          I gained working knowledge of Python, Django, Typescript, Node.js, AWS, CI/CD, git/GitHub, and Linux.
